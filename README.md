A project using the concept of TFL's oyster card to practice TDD, OOD and Ruby.

## My goals and progress:

### I write code that is easy to change

Project approached attempting to put into practice the Single Responsibility Principle and Dependency Injection.

### I can test-drive my code

Fully test-driven with 100% coverage.  

### I can build with objects

I reached and completed step 14 and so have practiced Extract Class Refactoring, creating three classes: Oystercard, Station and Journey.
